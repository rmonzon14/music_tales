LYRICS:
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin', 'cause I'm countin' no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare

Intangible (ah y'all), bet you didn't think
So I command you to, panoramic view (you)
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes?

Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional? Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy

Lifeless to those the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shift
Did you like it? Gut smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among knows possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics without did you make it?
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every sprouting tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes

I see destruction and demise
Corruption in the skies (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides

For me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind, that's the inner (fuck 'em)
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor

Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Cracker Island

On cracker Island it was born
To the collective of the dawn
They were planting seeds at night

To grow a made up paradise
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
But it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult) 
in end I had to pay (what world is this)
In the end I had to pay (I purged my soul)
In the end I had to pay (I drank to riot) 
Nothing more to say (I drank to riot)
 
They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x 2 
Fantasies 

What world is this? x2

On cracker island it was raised
By the collective from the grave
It only came out at night 
It ate up their paradise (paradise)
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
And it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult)
In the end I had to pay (what world is this)
Out there on my silverlake (I was not there)
In the end it will be great (beneath the hills)
I’m like a ship between the tides (I saw myself)
I held on I survived (there in the void)

They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x2
Fantasy

On cracker island It will die (forever cult)
Join the collective in the sky (forever cult)
And on a shining boat of light (forever cult)

Go up to paradise (what world is this) 
Where the truth is autotuned (I purged my soul)
And it’s sadness I consume (I drank to riot)
Into my formats everyday (I drank to riot)
In the end I had to pay (forever cult)

In the end I’ll have to pay (forever cult)
In the end I’ll be ok (forever cult)

Nothing more to say x3

Lyrics: 
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

Lyrics:
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to 
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers 
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do 
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through

Lyrics: 
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all
Over myself
To lick your heart
And taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we
Call it fall
I'll make it to the moon
If I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Lyrics: 
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Well separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up
And brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back

I gotta take it on the otherside

Well centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
The stranger things that never change my mind

I gotta take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long
Will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full
And I’m spillin' my guts
She want to know
Am I still a slut?

I gotta take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Mmm-push the trigger
And I pull the thread

I gotta to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Turn me on
Take me for a hard ride
Burn me out
Leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it’s born again

How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever had

(How long)
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s sad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Lyrics: 
Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on. 
When I sit alone, come get a little known 
But I need more than myself this time. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh 

When will I know that I really can't go 
To the well once more - time to decide on. 
Well it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside. 
Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride, 
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh 

The more I see the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go; 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow, 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

Ho! 
Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down. 
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do belive what we rely on, 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh 

The more I see, the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow. 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 
Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go. 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey oh yeah oh yeah... tell my love now 
Hey yeah yeah... oh yeah.

Lyrics: 
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you pick the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world? What does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Oh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty five
Just another way to survive

[Chorus:]
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

She's a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Chorus]

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say good bye to you
Too true to say say say...

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast...

Lyrics:
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black jack,dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it

And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow

Lyrics: 
Oh, oh

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, ""Hell, yes""
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiacbut I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go,blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut,well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah

Lyrics: 
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil, he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me, no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah

Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear cannon ball a roaring
Me? I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah
Whack for my daddy-o

Lyrics: 
New blood joins this Earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me

“‘Screaming Suicide’ addresses the taboo word of suicide. The intention is to communicate about the darkness we feel inside. It's ridiculous to think we should deny that we have these thoughts. At one point or another, I believe most people have thought about it. To face it is to speak the unspoken. If it's a human experience, we should be able to talk about it. You are not alone.”

LYRICS

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don’t recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide
 
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

And now you speak my name
You’ve given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don’t you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I’m exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I’m no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich & Robert Trujillo

↓ LYRICS ↓

It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway

I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life

↓ LYRICS ↓

In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Lyrics:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)

Lyrics:
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Lyrics:
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Lyrics:
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

Lyrics:
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin(I feel the light betray me)
(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within(I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(It's like)It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Lyrics:
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)Confusing what is real

Linkin Park is an alternative rock band renowned for their hits “Numb,” “In the End,” “What I’ve Done,” “Castle of Glass,” “New Divide,” “Crawling,” and “Faint.”  They worked with artists like Jay-Z, Metallica, Steve Aoki, and Paul McCartney — amassing billions of global streams and received the UN Global Leadership Award for their humanitarian work.

Lyrics:
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

About the The Razor's Edge:
AC/DC cracked the seal on the '90s with one of the best riffs of their career. That would be ""Thunderstruck,"" the opening track on The Razors Edge. In addition to ""Thunderstruck,"" the band brought out ""Moneytalks,"" probably the closest they ever came to writing a pop song. Then there was ""Are You Ready"" - one of their fiercest calls to action. The gritty edge and booming chants on this album were a welcome reminder for a new generation that pure, unadulterated rock 'n' roll was alive and well.

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah

[Verse 1]
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Bridge 1]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck

About the album:
Years of musical knowledge and understanding had passed between Angus and Malcolm Young by the time High Voltage announced the arrival of a new Australian take on rock. With Bon Scott on board, this 1976 American release reduced rock 'n' roll down to rhythm, riffs, and raunch.

Lyrics:
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doing one night stands
Try playin' in a rock roll band
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

Written & Composed by Michael Jackson
Produced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions
Co-Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc.
From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982
Released as a single January 2, 1983

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Steve Barron
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Billie Jean"" was the first of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December, 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status by the RIAA for US sales alone. The """"Billie Jean"""" single reached No. 1 in 10 countries in the spring of 1983, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the second-highest selling single in America that same year.

""Billie Jean"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 4, 1983, and Platinum on February 4, 1989. The song won two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance - Male, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Single - Pop/Rock and was also named the Single of the Year on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 1983.

The short film featured a paparazzo attempting to photograph Jackson as he danced through an urban landscape. A specially created set featured steps and sidewalk tiles that lit up underneath Michael's feet. It is here that fans first saw some of Michael's best-known dance moves, such as spinning and landing on his toes. Many of Michael's steps and mannerisms in the video would become forever associated with The King of Pop.

When the chorus hit.he sprung into this dance that was unlike anything I'd ever seen, director Steve Barron recounted of Jackson's choreography in the video. ""It was just extraordinary, instinctive. He pulled it all together and turned it into what we saw.The camera literally steamed up, the eyepiece steamed up, because of my heat from what I was seeing."" Barron also recalled the crew breaking into spontaneous applause after Michael finished dancing.

The ""Billie Jean"" short film made history as the first video by a black artist to be played in heavy rotation on MTV, then in its second year. In 1992, the short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. MTV ranked ""Billie Jean"" as the 35th greatest music video of all time in 1999, one of three entries of Jackson's on the chart alongside ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It.""

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Bruce Gowers
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Rock With You"" was the second of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in the United States in 1980, topping Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles charts and reaching No. 4 on Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 chart that same year.

""Rock With You"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 14, 1980, and Platinum of February 14, 1989. The song was ranked No. 82 on Rolling Stone and MTV's list of the 100 Greatest Pop Songs in 2000. In his 1988 memoir Moonwalk, Michael called ""Rock With You,"" written by Rod Temperton, ""the sort of thing I was aiming for"" in creating an album to his vision.

The short film featured Michael performing the song on a plain stage in a sequined jumpsuit and matching boots, a set of shimmering lasers illuminating his outfit from behind. Director Bruce Gowers praised Michael as ""an absolute professional"" in an interview with Rolling Stone. In 2014, the magazine would rank ""Rock With You"" No. 6 on a list of Michael Jackson's 20 Greatest Videos.

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Nick Saxon

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was the first of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in eight countries in 1979, topping Billboard's Hot 100, Hot Soul Singles and Hot Disco Singles charts as well as the Cash Box Top 100.

""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 29, 1979, and Platinum on February 14, 1989. The song won Michael his first solo Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 1980, as well as his first American Music Award for Favorite Single (Soul/R&B). ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was ranked No. 9 on the 100 Best Songs of the '70s by NME and No. 16 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Dance Songs.

""That song means a lot to me because it was the first song I wrote as a whole,"" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. ""'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' was my first big chance, and it went straight to Number One. It was the song that won me my first Grammy. Quincy had the confidence in me to encourage me to go into the studio by myself, which I appreciated.""

The short film featured Michael in performance against a dazzling background of geometric shapes and patterns. Wearing a tuxedo similar to his outfit on the Off the Wall album cover, Jackson sings and dances to the song, at one point even dancing with two other clones of himself, achieved through the magic of special effects.

Lyrics:

Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch youfixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again""",TRUE,TRUE,995490565

Right, right, turn off the lights
We're gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the deal, yo?
I love when it's all too much
5 a.m. turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won'tyou come on and come on and

And I don't need you,

And now that we're done,
I'm gonna show you tonight,
I'm alright,
I'm just fine,
And you're a tool,

“Cover Me In Sunshine”
 
I’ve been dreaming 
friendly faces
I’ve got so much time to kill
 
just imagine 
people laughing
I know some day we will
 
and even if it’s far away
get me through another day
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
 
from a distance 
all these mountains
are just some tiny hills
 
wildflowers 
they keep living 
while they’re just standing still 
 
I’ve been missing yesterday 
but what if theres a better place
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
 
La la la 
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine

Lyrics:

You took my hand
You showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh
That's right
I took your words
And I believed
In everything
You said to me
Yeah huh
That's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better
Cause you said forever
And ever
Who knew""",TRUE,TRUE,219363750

Nate Dogg [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO],Mydełko,1931315,18992,291,"‘Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
And gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse
Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around
Like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts
I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps, who want some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me",FALSE,FALSE,1548871694

And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Lyrics: 

2X
No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un dia fuimos
y lo peor es que 

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

De repente no eras el mismo
me dejaste por tu narcisismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos 

Tu distante con tu actitud 
y eso me llenaba de inquietud 
tú no daba ni la mitad 
pero sí sé que di más que tú 
estaba corriendo por alguien       
que por mí ni estaba caminando 

Este amor no muerto pero esta delirando
ya de lo que había ya no hay na
te lo digo con sinceridad 
tu estas frío como en Navidad 
es mejor que esto se acabe ya 
no me repita la movie otra vez que esa ya la vi 

Bebe yo te quiero pero es que yo me quiero más a mí 
es un adios necesario 
lo que un día fue increíble se volvió rutinario
no me saben a nada tus labios 
ahora es todo lo contrario 
y lo peor es que

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos (ambos)
eh eh eh (ambos)

Lyrics:
Por completarte me rompí en pedazos
Me lo advirtieron, pero no hice caso
Me di cuenta que lo tuyo es falso
Fue la gota que rebalsó el vaso

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
No me digas que lo sientes
Eso parece sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Esa filosofía barata no la compro
Lo siento, en esa moto ya no me monto
La gente de dos caras no la soporto
Yo que ponía las manos al fuego por ti
Y me tratas como una más de tus antojos
Tu herida no me abrió la piel, pero sí los ojos

Los tengo rojos de tanto llorar por ti

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
Y ahora resulta que lo sientes
Suena sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro & Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas (Ey, dice, Ra-Rauw)

[Verso 2: Rauw Alejandro]
Hablándote claro, no te necesito (Yeah)
Perdiste a alguien auténtico (Ah)
Algo me decía por qué no fluiamo' (¡Wuh!)
Te va a picar cuando recuerde’ cómo nos comíamo' (¡Yah!)
Como ante' (Ey)
Tú de espalda apoyándote del volante (Ey)
Quemando el tranquilizante
No te bloqueé de las rede' pa' que vea' la otra en la Mercede' (¡Yah!)

[Puente: Shakira]
No me cuente’ más historia’, no quiero saber
Cómo es que he sido tan ciega y no he podido ver
Te deberían dar un Oscar, lo has hecho tan bien

[Coro: Shakira & Rauw Alejandro]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

But you got it all

Si es cuestion de confesar
No se preparar cafe
Y no entiendo de futbol
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
Juego mal hasta el parques
Y jamas uso reloj
Y para ser mas franca nadie
Piensa en ti como lo hago yo
Aunque te de lo mismo
Si es cuestion de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que tambien
Lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frio
Conmigo nada es facil
Ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido
El cielo esta cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada dia que pasa es uno mas
Parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de
Olvidarte porque
Seguir amandote es inevitable
Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hayque hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo""

Lyrics:
2,3,5!
 
Maybe If I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There’s shadows on the wall, wish I would’ve ran
Gotta get away I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man 
Maybe I’ll be gone before you count to 10
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Maybe if we went another way
I wouldn’t be regretting the decisions that I made
I don’t want to spend another day
Looking for somebody that I know I can’t replace
My tears fall you don’t miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history 
I think I’m broke and nothing can fix me
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
 
Yeah
We were built to fall apart
But I can’t feel you now
And it’s too late now there’s no point screaming
Dug your grave so fuck your feelings
No one’s here so now you’re on your own
 
I made up my mind this evening
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
Drink while my conscious eats me 
I’m taking the last I’m taking the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
I’m ready to let you go
This time is the last this time is the last

LYRICS

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home, someone take me
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feets, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home(It's been a long time coming)
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hooome, hooome
Someone take me
Hooooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Hoooome, hooome
Look, I been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever
Just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the
Devil in the face and make it home safe
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair?
I'm trying to find
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Hoooome, hooome (take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me
Hoooome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home(Hoooome, hooome)
(Take me home)
Someone take me

Lyrics:
Screaming when we fuck
Screaming when we fight yeah
Even when I’m drunk
You’re my only type yeah
 
Please don’t break my heart
I know that you might yeah
Tell me tell me now,
are you bout that life? yeah
 
Bonnie & Clyde 
ready to die 
Two
Gravesites 
later tonight 
you
Told me to stop waiting
I can feel your back breaking
Face down 
lay pipe
Water works 
swim your pool
Backstroke we both naked 
I can see that ass shaking
Damn yeah 
 
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
  
I love chaos I love toxic
I love wreckage I love falling
Pics you’re taking pics you’re cropping
It’s hard lately I’m exhausted
You hate my guts then you love me
You make me feel so disgusting
Can’t stop a runner from running
So go, go, go
You’re my only drug
You’re my only vice yeah
Fighting then we fuck
You’re my only type yeah
Mixing bad decisions up with one night stands and Hennessey
All I’ve got’s this broken heart but you can have the rest of me
 
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
Break up just to make up
You’re gone when I wake up
 
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying
When you come back I’ll be waiting
There’s something you’re not saying

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stone like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & both]
Fuck you, goodbye (Yeah)
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

Lyrics:
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I wrote a letter to myself
in the form of a song I can play when the sun shines
I know better than to trust
anything that I say to myself when I’m this high
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I just did an interview with my eyes closed
I just sparked a blunt it looked like pyro
Only comments I see are the bad ones
Only playlists I like are the sad ones
 
I let the medicine in
I know it don’t help in the end
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7
I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7pm
 
I cut my hair
off like I’m Britney
sparkle dust
like a pixie
Wipe my nose
like it’s itchy
I’m tatted up,
I don’t give a fuck
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
(LIL WAYNE v.)
 
When I’m this high
When I’m this high
I just looked in the mirror who is this guy
It’s a full moon
Where the good shrooms
I’m too fucking high
Sound like a good school
Higher than Jehovah
High where the heaven’s at
You know Ima get pulled over
Ima need a chauffer
Lean in my soda
So Ima need a shoulder
Why y’all got your noses up
I smell like guns and roses
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)

Letra de EQUIS ""X"" 

Aquel día te vi y tu energia sentí
Desde eso no te quiero lejos de mi
Sé que no sabes de mi y no te puedo mentir
Lo que dicen en la calle sobre mi

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar (no te lo puedo negar)
Estamos claros y ya (estamos claros, estamos claros)

Solo deja que yo te agarre baby
Besos en el cuello pa' calmar la sed
Mi mano en tus caderas pa' empezar como es
No le vamo' a bajar mas nunca mamá

Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Baila
Placata Placata 
Como ella lo mueve
Sin parar, sin parar

Mis ganas de comerte
Ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

Lo que he visto de ti mami no me es normal
Pero no te preocupes que soy anormal
Sé que tus amigas no les debo gustar

Pero ve y cuentale parte por parte
Como tenemos sex y te quito el estres
Dale otra vez

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba- Baila
Placata Placata 
Como ella lo mueve
Sin parar, sin parar

Mis ganas de comerte
Ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte

Y no te voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claros y ya

The Avengers.

(Intro)
Lenny: Desde que estábamos en la high escribías mi nombre en tu cuaderno. 
Yo pienso en ti cuando estoy high.
Y ahora picheas pa’ comernos (vamos a vernos). 

Sech: Dame un ratito y más na’ (más na’). 
Después si quieres no te escribo más na’ (más na’).
Parezco Google buscándote.
Quiero hacer una serie que se llame “toda la noche dándote”. 
Baby

Dalex: Dime si andas con ese bobo o andas sola. 
Yo en el Mercedes y él te tiene en el Corolla.
Si un día de estos baby él a ti te descuida yo voy a hacerte mía. 

(Coro)
Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Sech: Te digo cuándo, hora y dónde pasa. 
Que le pague a la gente de Waze.
Pa’ que borren el location de mi casa.
Vendo noviecito cuernudo a la brasa. 
Y si mi plan fracasa mañana vuelve y pasa. 
Acuérdate cuando lo hicimos. 
En el carro, en la cocina, esta serie no termina.
Baby te tenía siempre encima. 
Piensa en un número, ya te lo imaginas.

Nicky Jam: Me dice que me vaya. 
Me pide que me quede.
Tú siempre estás jugando. 
Contigo no se puede.
Hasta que te me trepas encima, yeah. 
Te pongo disciplina, yeah.
Nunca la dejo caer. 
Siempre me pide otra vez. 
Otra vez la tengo llamándome. 
No se olvida de cómo la traté. 
Que los planes todos se los cambié. 
Y su novio ahora se volvió su ex. 

Lenny: Hey, mañana avísame si acaso te demoras.
Pa' enseñarte cómo una pussy se devora.
Una nueve-seis al revés, tú sabes como es.
En menos de una hora.

Shorty
Yo sé tus problemas con los jumper 
No te cabe el bumper. 
Yo entro en ese party.
Di que vas con tus amigas sola. 
Que en mi cama hay un party. 

Justin: ¡Ay Justin Quiles mami!
Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cuando te lo hacía. 
Cómo te venías. 

Sech: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías.

Justin: ¿Qué fue te dio alzheimer?
Se te olvidó todas las veces que te comía en el driveway.
De desayuno, de cena.
Te batía la maizena.
Y ahora le dices que no estuve en la escena.
Para.
Deja de estar metiendo fecas.
Si te lo hice hasta dentro de la discoteca.
Por facetime te ponía a hacer caras.
Y tú te tocabas.

Feid: Dime cuándo nos tomamos el Old Fashion. 
Ponme un caption. 
Y al novio tuyo le ponemos los cachos. 
Yo quiero repetir la dosis.
Tú que no y yo que sí. 
Otro en el jacuzzi. 
Suave. 
Que tu gato ya no puede vernos pa’ comernos.
Siempre tenemos que escondernos.
Qué chimba, como en el colegio. 
Mami si te llamo es pa’ poder hacerlo.

Dalex: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Rafa Pabón: Rafa Pabón
Vamos a repetirlo, tres, seis.
No hay que decirlo. 
Dime si quieres sentirlo.
Es que no es lo mismo oírlo que vivirlo.
Si lo subes mami tienes que disminuirlo.
Encima, trépate, como en el colegio.
Acuérdate. 
Quería pichar y del parque se la saqué.
Todos sus trucos ya los anoté. 
Y a su gato se la quité.

Dalex: En la cama se guayó.
Tus poses favoritas el que las sabe soy yo.
Fui un sniper, en tu cuerpo el que nunca falló.
No tiene que aceptarlo pero sé que fui yo, fui yo.

Sech: Baby

Dalex: Dime si andas con ese bobo o andas sola. 
Yo en el Mercedes y él te tiene en el Corolla.
Si un día de estos baby él a ti te descuida yo voy a hacerte mía. 

Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías. 

Nicky Jam: Dime cuándo vamos a vernos pa’ comernos. 
Si se te olvidó yo te lo recuerdo.
Cómo te lo hacía. 
Cuando te venías.

Lyrics:
Si te preguntan qué pasó entrenos
Que eso se quede entre nosotros dos
No des la versión tuya
Porque eso no me ayuda

Si ni tan malo fui (eh)
Pa’ que hables mal de mi (eh)
Si no es bueno, no digas nada
Y si te cuesta quedarte callada

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Ahora me tienes como el malo del cuento a mi
Después que mi corazón completo te lo di
No te pido que regreses
Pero cuando lo beses
No puedas dejar de pensar en mi

Sé que me escucho egoísta
Pero siento que lo mío me lo quitan
De protagonista te quedó el papel
Jugando un juego donde solamente gana el, pero

Diles también que yo soy el único
Que a ti te eriza la piel
Y te pudo complacer
Cuando ‘toy borracho pienso
En todo lo intense
Que tú y yo
Tuvimos en aquel viejo hotel

Just let me know, nena
Si nada te llena
Muero, vuelvo y nazco y gano de cualquier manera
Just let me know nena
Cuando tú quieras
Te hago el amor como si nada pasó
Roooyce
Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Y si te
Preguntan en tu casa
Usa más la cabeza
Luego yo con qué cara voy a beber con tu pai cerveza
Tu mai que tanto me ama
No vaya a ser que me odie
Si se entera lo que hice
Puede que no me perdone

Está cabrón lo sé
Lo nuestro lo maté
Pero fueron más cosas buenas que contigo pasé
Ayer entré a ver tus fotos
Y encontré una de nosotros
Quizás tú quieres volver
A la verdad que ‘toy loco

Ta’ bien diles que no fui el mejor
Pero no me hagas ver como un perdedor
Diles que conmigo conociste el amor
Que no eran frías mis noches en Nueva York

También diles que te hice llorar (oh, oh)
Pero que fue de felicidad (oh, oh)
Mejor pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar
No vaya a ser que tú me vayas a extrañar

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Out now: http://thebeatles.lnk.to/AbbeyRoad2019
For more information visit http://abbeyroad.thebeatles.com
 
Abbey Road presented with new mixes in stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos; expanded with previously unreleased session recordings and demos.
 
Super deluxe 4 disc set, 3 LP deluxe vinyl, 2 CD deluxe, limited edition picture disc, CD, LP, digital and streaming. Available everywhere September 27, 2019.
 
On August 8, 1969, the world’s most famous band stepped out from London’s EMI Recording Studios to stride, single-file, across the black and white stripes of Abbey Road’s nearby zebra crossing. With photographer Iain Macmillan balanced on a stepladder and one policeman stopping the street’s light traffic, The Beatles crossed back and forth three times, led by John Lennon, followed by Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. Just six photos were taken, with the fifth selected as the cover shot for The Beatles’ penultimate studio album, Abbey Road, named after the tree-lined street in which the studios are located.
 
Released September 26, 1969, Abbey Road was not The Beatles’ final album, as Let It Be followed in 1970, but it was the last one John, Paul, George, and Ringo recorded together as a band. The Beatles celebrated Abbey Road’s anniversary with a suite of beautifully presented packages released worldwide on September 27, 2019 by Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe. Now available, the album’s 17 tracks are newly mixed by producer Giles Martin and mix engineer Sam Okell in stereo, high res stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos, accompanied by 23 session recordings and demos, most of which are previously unreleased.

We might not get tomorrow, let's do it tonight
Don't care what they say, or what games they play
Nothing is enough, 'til they handle love (Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you to stay, I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (Hey)

Letra/Lyrics:
Chorus

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around (Daddy Yankee!)
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down (Mr Worldwide!)

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar (Play-N-Skillz!)
Ten cuidao’ con el fuego, te va a quemar (Let’s ride)
 
We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

Pit verse

That money, that money, that money we get it
And if it’s bout billions you know that we with it
And if it’s that fire, you know that we get it
Yankee, Pit, we don’t rap it we live it
Siempre somos los dueños del juego
Billones, billones, empezamos de zero
Esto no para, esto sigue, sigue
Dale Yankee dile, dile…

DY verse
(Fuego!)
Dinero Dinero ese ha sido el enfoque
Querido en el mundo y amado en los bloques
Yo creo en la higiene los chavos pal’ pote
Lavando el dinero me hice un bichote
Puré pa’ la calle lo que tiro es puro
Toa’ la familia ya estamos seguros
Los tiempos duros no duran para siempre
Los que duran para siempre son los duros.

Chorus

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar
Ten cuidao’ con el fuego, te va a quemar
 
We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

We makin’ it hot, we makin’ it hot
Dinero, dinero y no vamo’ a parar

Girls in the club know the deal when we come around
They show us love cuz they know how we put it down

Tamo’ en alta nunca le vamo’ a bajar

Sean Paul ft J Balvin- Contra La Pared (SPANISH)

J Balvin part:

De día y de noche me llama 
Que quiere de nuevo en mi cama 
No fue suficiente una vez 
Y ahora de día y de noche reclama 

Cucara macara di que fue 
Ya me tienes contra la pared 
Pide una vez pide dos pide tres 
Otra vez llegamos hasta diez 

Se ennota 
se fuma sola la huka 
se pide un trago de fruta 
Yo se como es que disfruta
Como le gusta 

Se ennota 
Se quita sola la ropa 
Se da otro shot a las rocas 
Se que todo le provoca cuando se aloca

Sean’s part : 

Night & day!
Want me in her bed! 
Ooh yeah! That’s what she said!

Because I set to the fire to thing when I gave her one time, 
She lovin’ it so much she have it pon speed dial,
Eye them a meet & Mi give her two times, deso when me start see the girl a get wild, 
Three time Mi give her the wickedest wine, she lovin’ that style and she love the profile,
Four time mi give her that grind (not sure about this first part)
Loco Losing her mind,
Fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego!
Anytime she want me to set it on fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego!

Anytime she wah to get it she call me, anytime she wah collect it she call me! See the fire hose deh , me wet it, she call me! 
Cause she know me nah pet it, she call me! Gyal say she just can’t forget it! 
Night & day!
Wah me in a her bed! Oh yeah!
That’s what she said!
Say she want one more chance!
Otra vez! Llego mustard yes! 

She might as well be attached to me, now she can’t go a day without chat to me, said she love the way mi give her love naturally, 
And she can’t stay away, snap back to me, she gridlock to me, 
Fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego! 
Anytime she want me to set it on fuego! Say the gyal a bawl fuego! 
Gyal say she just can’t forget it!
Night & day! She Wah me in her bed! That’s what she said!




Sean Paul ft J Balvin- Contra La Pared (ENGLISH)

J Balvin part:

Day and night she calls me
What do you want in my bed again
It was not enough once
And now, day and night, he claims

Cucara macara di that was (cucara macara is more an onomatopoeia and not a WORD)
You already have me against the wall
Ask once asks for two requests three
Again we get to ten

It is noted
the hookah smokes alone
a drink of fruit is requested
I know how she enjoys
As you like

It is noted
She takes off her clothes alone
Another shot is given to the rocks
I know that everything provokes him when she goes crazy

Sean’s part : 

Night & day!
Want me in her bed! 
Ooh yeah! That’s what she said!

Because I set to the fire to thing when I gave her one time, 
She lovin’ it so much she have it pon speed dial,
Eye them a meet & Mi give her two times, deso when me start see the girl a get wild, 
Three time Mi give her the wickedest wine, she lovin’ that style and she love the profile,
Four time mi give her that grind (not sure about this first part)
Loco Losing her mind,

Lyrics:
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on our green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why

[Verse 2]
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear


[Bridge]
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly (He can fly)

[Verse 3]
Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
Still, I am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now

[Outro]
Let it come true right now
Oh, yeah",TRUE,TRUE,19601041

Lyrics:

California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that Sunshine State where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, shake it baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it mama
Shake it
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it mama
Shake it, Cali
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown
Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco
And you know L.A. up in this
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?
Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it on this Westside
'Cause you and I know it's the best side
Yeah, that's right
West Coast, West Coast
California love
California love, yeah
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep 'em rockin', we keep 'em rockin'

Just come on shake, shake it, baby
Baby, baby, shake it mama, shake it mama, shake it mama

Tupac Amaru Shakur born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac, Makaveli, and Pac, was an American rapper and actor. As of 2007, Shakur has sold over 75 million records worldwide. His double disc albums All Eyez on Me (1996) and his Greatest Hits (1998) are among the best-selling albums in the United States. Shakur is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time, and he has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of any genre by many publications, including Rolling Stone, which ranked him 86th on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. On April 7, 2017, Shakur was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Shakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer, and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground, eventually branching off as a solo artist. Most of the themes in Shakur's songs revolved around the violence and hardship in inner cities, racism, and other social problems. Both of his parents and several other people in his family were members of the Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs. During the latter part of his career, Shakur was a vocal participant during the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, becoming involved in conflicts with other rappers, producers, and record-label staff members, most notably The Notorious B.I.G. and the label Bad Boy Records. Apart from his career in music, Shakur was also an actor, starring in various films and TV programs in the 1990s, including Poetic Justice (1993), Gang Related (1997) and Gridlock'd (1997).

On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died from his injuries six days later.


Although Shakur began recording in 1987, his professional entertainment career did not take off until the early 1990s when he debuted in Digital Underground's ""Same Song"" from the soundtrack to the 1991 film Nothing but Trouble, and also appeared with the group in the film. The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground extended play (EP) This Is an EP Release, the follow-up to their debut hit album Sex Packets. Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. After his rap debut, he performed with Digital Underground again on the album Sons of the P. Shakur went on to feature Shock G and Money-B from Digital Underground in his track ""I Get Around"", which ranked #11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

In November 1991, Shakur released his debut solo album, 2Pacalypse Now. Though the album did not generate any ""Top Ten"" hits, 2Pacalypse Now is hailed by many critics and fans for its underground feel, with many rappers such as Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli having pointed to it as inspiration. Although the album was originally released on Interscope Records, the rights to its distribution are now owned by Amaru Entertainment, the label owned by Shakur's mother. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film Apocalypse Now.

2Pacalypse Now generated significant controversy for numerous reasons. The songs ""Trapped"" and ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney claimed he was influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, ""There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society."" Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, ""I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang,"" Shakur said. ""I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. 

His second studio album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., was released in February 1993. The album did better than its predecessor both critically and commercially, debuting at number 24 on the Billboard 200. The album contains many tracks emphasizing Shakur's political and social views, and there are noticeable differences in production from his first effort. While 2Pacalypse Now had an indie-rap-oriented sound, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... is generally considered Shakur's ""breakout"" album. It spawned the hits ""Keep Ya Head Up"" and ""I Get Around"" and reached platinum status. On vinyl, Side A (tracks 1–8) was labeled the ""Black Side"" and Side B (tracks 9–16) the ""Dark Side"". It is Shakur's tenth-biggest selling album, with 1,366,000 units moved as of 2004.",FALSE,FALSE,211103197

TRADUZIONE TESTO

[Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
Non ho paura, niente affatto
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai paura del buio?
Io non ho paura
Non ho paura, anche dall'inizio
Non ho paura del buio
Del buio, mmm

[Lil Wayne]
Tunechi
Non ho mai paura e non sono mai inorridito
Ho appena guardato il mio Rolex, ha detto che sono i tempi più bui
Non sono mai terrorizzato, non sono mai pietrificato
Sai che vedo dei morti, li dico solo ""Fatti una vita""
Non ho mai “paura”, non sono sicuro che sia una parola, ma
Intendo ogni parola, sentendomi come ""non disturbare"", aspetta
Lasciami testimoniare, non ho mai testimoniato
E sono sposato con il mio orgoglio, non ho mai, mai pianto
Ho gli occhi come biglie, se piango brillano
Sai che posso leggere la tua mente come se fossi l'autore
C'è una linea per domani e quella linea si sta accorciando
Sono dietro il grilletto, e se fossi il bersaglio?
Profondo sospiro, un sayōnara, non ho paura di morire
E’ addio o buongiorno, e il cielo inizia a cadere
E io sto risplendendo nell'oscurità
Ripenso al mio Rolex, dice ""Tempo per il coro""
Sai che non ho paura

[Lil Wayne & Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, niente affatto
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai paura del buio?
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Io non ho paura
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, anche dall'inizio
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Del buio, mmm
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Si, si, si, si

[XXXTENTACION]
Si
Ok, metti il mio cuore da parte
Nei miei sentimenti, cavalchiamo
Grossa MAC di fianco
Se lei chiama, scivolerò
""La mia piccola"" Amico, sei pazzo
Potrebbe ottenere una nuova Mercedes
Lei dice che mi vuole, oowee
Ok, piccolina, facciamolo, uh-huh

[XXXTENTACION]
Se potessi contare le lacrime che ho versato
Un milione di volte, giuro che sono morto
Ci sto provando, ma non va ancora bene
L'unica volta che la voglio è di notte

[Lil Wayne & Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, niente affatto
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)

Lyrics:
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I wrote a letter to myself
in the form of a song I can play when the sun shines
I know better than to trust
anything that I say to myself when I’m this high
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I just did an interview with my eyes closed
I just sparked a blunt it looked like pyro
Only comments I see are the bad ones
Only playlists I like are the sad ones
 
I let the medicine in
I know it don’t help in the end
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7
I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7pm
 
I cut my hair
off like I’m Britney
sparkle dust
like a pixie
Wipe my nose
like it’s itchy
I’m tatted up,
I don’t give a fuck
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
(LIL WAYNE v.)
 
When I’m this high
When I’m this high
I just looked in the mirror who is this guy
It’s a full moon
Where the good shrooms
I’m too fucking high
Sound like a good school
Higher than Jehovah
High where the heaven’s at
You know Ima get pulled over
Ima need a chauffer
Lean in my soda
So Ima need a shoulder
Why y’all got your noses up
I smell like guns and roses
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)

Don't cry snowman, not in front of me
Who will catch your tears if you can't catch me, darlin'?
If you can't catch me, darlin'?
Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'till death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas baby
My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?
Without legs to run, honey?
Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?
If you don't have ears, baby?
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'till death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go

Lyrics:

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade - it mightbe too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

#ABBA #DancingQueen #Remastered

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life 
see that girl, watch that scene 
digging the Dancing Queen 

Friday night and the lights are low 
looking out for the place to go 
where they play the right music, getting in the swing 
you come to look for a king 

Anybody could be that guy 
night is young and the music’s high 
with a bit of rock music, everything is fine 
you’re in the mood for a dance 
and when you get the chance 

You are the Dancing Queen 
young and sweet only seventeen 
Dancing Queen feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
you can dance, you can jive 
having the time of your life 
see that girl, watch that scene 
digging the Dancing Queen 

You’re a teaser, you turn ’em on 
leave ’em burning and then you’re gone 
looking out for another anyone will do 
you’re in the mood for a dance 
and when you get the chance 

You are the Dancing Queen 
young and sweet only seventeen 
Dancing Queen feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah 
you can dance, you can jive 
having the time of your life 
see that girl, watch that scene 
digging the Dancing Queen

Lyrics:

Half past twelve 
and I’m watchin’ the late show 
in my flat all alone 
how I hate to spend 
the evening on my own 
autumn winds 
blowin’ outside the window 
as I look around the room 
and it makes me so 
depressed to see the gloom 
there’s not a soul out there 
no one to hear my prayer 

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
won’t somebody help me 
chase the shadows away 
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
take me through the darkness 
to the break of the day 

Movie stars 
find the end of the rainbow 
with a fortune to win 
it’s so different from 
the world I’m living in 
tired of TV 
I open the window 
and I gaze into the night 
but there’s nothing there to see 
no one in sight 
there’s not a soul out there 
no one to hear my prayer 

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
won’t somebody help me 
chase the shadows away 
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
A man after midnight 
take me through the darkness 
to the break of the day

#ABBA #Waterloo #Remastered

Lyrics:

My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender 
oh yeah, and I have met my destiny 
in quite a similar way 
the history book on the shelf 
is always repeating itself 

Waterloo – I was defeated, you won the war 
Waterloo – promise to love you for ever more 
Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo 

My, my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger 
oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance 
is giving up the fight 
and how could I ever refuse 
I feel like I win when I lose 

Waterloo – I was defeated, you won the war 
Waterloo – promise to love you for ever more 
Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo 

So how could I ever refuse 
I feel like I win when I lose – 

Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo

The original studio version of ‘My Way’ was recorded on December 30, 1968 in one take. ‘My Way’ has gone on to become an all-time classic, a song which will be forever associated with the Chairman of the Board, as one of his signature tunes, and one which Frank Sinatra regularly closed his live shows with.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The audio and video of this is ""out of sync."" The audio and video are from two different sources. But, at least you can get an idea of how they look singing this #1 hit together.


""Somethin' Stupid,"" also known as ""Something Stupid,"" is a song written by C. Carson Parks. It was originally recorded in 1966 by Parks and his wife Gaile Foote, as Carson and Gaile. The song is best known in the 1967 version by Frank Sinatra and his daughter Nancy Sinatra, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 2001, a cover version by British vocalist Robbie Williams and Australian actress Nicole Kidman reached number one in the UK Singles Chart.


Nancy Sandra Sinatra (born June 8, 1940)] is an American singer and actress. She is the elder daughter of Frank Sinatra and Nancy (Barbato) Sinatra, and is widely known for her 1966 signature hit ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"".

Other defining recordings include ""Sugar Town"", the 1967 number one ""Somethin' Stupid"" (a duet with her father), the title song from the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood such as ""Jackson"", ""Summer Wine"" and her cover of Cher's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"". She appeared on TV in high boots, and with colorfully dressed go-go dancers, creating a popular and enduring image of the Swinging Sixties. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including ""Some Velvet Morning"". In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.

Sinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid-1960s, including a co-starring role with Elvis Presley in the movie Speedway, and with Peter Fonda in The Wild Angels. In Marriage on the Rocks, Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter.


The Wrecking Crew is a 2008 American documentary film directed by Denny Tedesco, son of the great guitarist Tommy Tedesco. It covers the story of the Los Angeles–based group of session musicians usually known as “The Wrecking Crew,” famed for having played on numerous hit recordings throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. The film premiered at the 2008 “South by Southwest” Film Festival.  It was not released theatrically until 2015.

Popular music of the 1960s was dominated by young bands like the Beach Boys, the Mamas & the Papas, Jan and Dean, and the Monkees. Listening to rock and roll on jukeboxes and car radios created devoted fans of these groups, whose music communicated the optimism and sorrow of a generation contending with strong countercultural forces.

Record companies happily supplied the public with new songs and musical groups, all packaged with artistic photographs and biographical profiles.

Left out of the story was an important historical fact: the bands, in some, but not all, cases, did NOT play the instruments heard on their records. Instead, the task of recording the perfect tempo, pitch, and timbre fell to a small group of accomplished session musicians.

The Wrecking Crew documents the work of studio players who recorded the tracks for such hits as ""California Dreamin'"", ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"", ""Be My Baby"", ""The Beat Goes On"", and ""Good Vibrations""  Interviews with producers, engineers, and session musicians reveal the warmth and humor that allowed their collective talents to turn a simple chord chart into an international phenomenon.",FALSE,FALSE,182673374

so it might hurt to hear this

And I can’t do this for another day

Lyrics: 
You won’t see me crying on the bathroom floor
I ain’t never coming back for more
Wanna see you walking out that door
Bye bye bye bye 
You won’t see me begging for a second chance
Say I need you cos it don’t make sense
Boy you just lost a ten out of ten
Won’t lie lie lie
 
Tonight I’m gon be rockin it
Droppin it
Shake my ass no stoppin it
I look hot in it
Hot in it 
I look hot in it
 
Movin’ ‘til my feet get sore
Hands all on me ‘til my dress gets torn
Watch me do it do it real hardcore, my my my
You and me we never ever made much sense
I’m too independent no offense boy
Don’t be sad about the things I said
Don’t cry cry cry
 
Tonight I’m gon be rockin it
Droppin it
Shake my ass no stoppin it
I look hot in it
Hot in it 
I look hot in it

La arena
 
Imagínate
Tú y yo, en la playa
La arena
El mar
El sonido de las olas
Recorriendo todo tu cuerpo
Bésame
Tócame
 
Y baila conmigo
 
La arena
 
Pasa su mano
Por todo mi cuerpo
Lentamente
Bailamos al ritmo del Tïesto
 
Tú y yo, en la playa
La arena
El mar
El sonido de las olas
Recorriendo
 
Imagínate
Tú y yo, en la playa
La arena
El mar

“‘Jackie Chan’ came together pretty spontaneously. Dzeko and I have been friends with Post for some time. When we met Preme in Las Vegas, he showed us the vocal he and Post had been working on and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to collaborate. I’m really excited to put this out for you all to hear. We’ve definitely created a summer anthem with this one.”

LYRICS:
She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

Drop top how we rollin’ down on Collins South Beach
Look like Kelly Rowland, this might be my destiny.
She want me to eat it, I guess dinner’s on me.
Know I got the sauce, like a fucking recipe.

She just wanna do it for the ‘gram
She just want this money in my hand.
Ima give it to her when she dance dance dance.
She gon’ catch an Uber out to Calabasas.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan

I think you got the wrong impression bout me baby, (bout me baby)
Just cause they heard what hood I’m from, they think I’m crazy (they think I’m crazy)
OK, well maybe just a little crazy (just a little)
Cause I admit I’m crazy bout that lady, yea, yea

Finger to the world, it’s fuck you pay me. (I been slavin’)
Run the pussy, cause I’m running out of patience. (no more waitin’)
No, no, bouncing like a yo-yo, 
Livin’ life on fast-forward, but we fuck in slo-mo. (yea)

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.

I can’t wait for the show, oh, oh.
Got that good yea, I know, oh, oh.
You should not be alone, oh, oh
All this drink got me throwed, oh, oh, oh.

Club got me right, and I feel so alive
She don’t want a thing, she don’t wanna be no wife.
She just wanna stay all night, she just wanna sniff the white.
Can’t tell her nothing, no can’t tell her nothing, no.

She say she’s too young, don’t want no man.
So she gon’ call her friends, now that’s a plan,
I just ordered sushi from japan,
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan.",TRUE,TRUE,782756255

#EltonJohn #BritneySpears #HoldMeCloser
This stunning dance video for Hold Me Closer, shot in Mexico City by the award winning director Tanu Muino beautifully capturing an immeasurable feeling of intimacy so missing from the world through the turmoil and chaos of recent times.
Tanu said, ""This was an emotional one for me as I grew up with Britney. After seeing ""Slave For You,"" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, ""Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.""

The “Don't Go Breaking My Heart” video was shot all in one take with a three-camera setup by Mike Mansfield. During the instrumental section, Elton attempts to teach Kiki a version of the “hand jive”, a 1950s dance that would resurge in popularity with the release of the film Grease.

Lyrics:
Build a fire and gather ‘round the tree
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me
 
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine let’s toast and pray for December snow
I know there’s been pain this year but it’s time to let it go
Next year you never know, but for now
Merry Christmas
 
We’ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We’ve both known love, but this love that we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes then you would know
My god you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas 
 
The fire is raging on
And we’ll all sing along to the songs
Just having so much fun
While we’re here can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone
Merry Christmas everyone

So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe 
Pour out the wine let’s toast and pray for December snow
I know there’s been pain this year but it’s time to let it go
Next year you never know, but for now
Merry Christmas

We’ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We’ve both known love, but this love that we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes then you would know
My god you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas 

I feel it when it comes
Every year helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All our family and friends are together where we all belong
Merry Christmas everyone
 
It’s Christmas time for you and I
We’ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas 
It’s Christmas time for you and I
We’ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas

""Ahora te Puedes Marchar""

Letras:
Si tú me hubieras dicho siempre la verdad
Si hubieras respondido cuando te llamé
Si hubieras amado cuando te amé
Serías en mis sueños la mejor mujer
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Si tú superas lo que yo sufrí por ti
Teniendo que olvidarte sin saber por qué
Y ahora me llamas, me quieres ver
Me juras que has cambiado y pensas en volver
Si no supiste amar ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar
Contigo yo perdí, ya tengo con quién ganar

Ya sé que no hubo nadie
Que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso comprendo que estás aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar
Contigo yo perdí, ya tengo con quién ganar

Ya sé que no hubo nadie
Que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso comprendo que estás aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

""La Incondicional"" 

Tú, la misma siempre tú
Amistad, ternura, que se yo.

Tú, mi sombra has sido tú
La historia de un amor
Que no fue nada.

Tú, mi eternamente tú
Un hotel, tu cuerpo y un adiós.

Tú, mi oculta amiga, tú
Un golpe de pasión
Amor de madrugada.

No existe un lazo entre tú y yo
Nada de amores
Nada de nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La incondicional
La que no espera nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La que no supe amar
No sé porqué.

Tú, intensamente tú
Soledad, cariño yo que se
Tú, mis horas bajas, tú.

Un cuerpo de mujer
Un par de rosas blancas.

No existe un lazo entre tú y yo
No hubo promesas
Ni juramentos
Nada de nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La incondicional
La que no espera nada.

Tú, la misma de ayer
La que no supe amar
No sé porqué.

""La Media Vuelta""

Te vas porque yo quiero que te vayas
A la hora que yo quiera te detengo
Yo sé que mi cariño te hace falta
Porque quieras o no
Yo soy tu dueño

Yo quiero que te vayas por el mundo
Y quiero que conozcas mucha gente
Yo quiero que te besen otros labios
Para que me compares
Hoy, como siempre

Si encuentras un amor que te comprenda
Y sientas que te quiere más que nadie
Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde

Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde

Yo quiero que te vayas por el mundo
Y quiero que conozcas mucha gente
Yo quiero que te besen otros labios
Para que me compares
Hoy, como siempre

Si encuentras un amor que te comprenda
Y sientas que te quiere más que nadie
Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde

Entonces yo daré la media vuelta
Y me iré con el sol
Cuando muera la tarde
Te vas porque yo quiero que te vayas

""Por Debajo de la Mesa""

Por debajo de la mesa
Acaricio tu rodilla y bebo
Sorbo a sorbo tu mirada
Angelical y respiro de tu
Boca esa flor de maravilla
Las alondras del deseo
Cantan, vuelan, vienen, van

Y me muero por llevarte
Al rincón de mi guarida
En donde escondo un beso
Con matiz de una ilusión
Se nos va acabando el trago
Sin saber qué es lo que hago
Si contengo mis instintos
O jamás te dejo ir

Y es que no sabes lo que tu me
Haces sentir
Si tu pudieras un minuto
Estar en mi
Tal vez te fundirías
A esta hoguera de mi sangre
Y vivirías aquí y yo abrazado a ti

Y es que no sabes lo que tú
Me haces sentir
Que no hay momento que
Yo pueda estar sin ti
Me absorbes el espacio
Y despacio me haces tuyo
Muere el orgullo en mi
Y es que no puedo estar sin ti

Me absorbes el espacio
Y despacio me haces tuyo
Muere el orgullo en mi
Y es que no puedo estar sin ti

Pensaba que yo lo tenía todo
Tantos amigos, caprichos
Amores locos.

Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y el sabor de tu piel
Bella como el sol de abril
Que absurdo el día en que soñé
Que eras para mí.
Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y la humedad de tu cuerpo
Tu me hecho porque sí
Seguir las huellas de tu olor
Loco por tu amor.

Se ve que no te voy
Se ve que no me vas
Pues tengo todo
Menos tu mirada
Y sin tus ojos
Mis ojos ya no ven nada.

Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y el sabor de tu piel
Bella como el sol de abril
Que absurdo el día en que soñé
Que eras para mí.

Me sobra juventud
Me muero por vivir
Pero me faltas tu.

Tengo todo excepto a ti
Y la humedad de tu cuerpo
Tu me has hecho por que si
Seguir las huellas de tu olor
Loco por tu amor.

""No Sé Tú""

No sé tú
Pero yo no dejo de pensar
Ni un minuto me logro despojar
De tus besos, tus abrazos
De lo bien que la pasamos la otra vez

No sé tú
Pero yo quisiera repetir
El cansancio que me hiciste sentir
Con la noche que me diste
Y el momento que con besos construiste

No sé tú
Pero yo te he comenzado a extrañar
En mi almohada no te dejo de pensar
Con las gentes mis amigos y las calles
Sin testigos

No sé tú
Pero yo te busco en cada amanecer
Mis deseos no los puedo contener
En las noches cuando duermo
Sin imsomnio yo me enfermo
Me haces falta mucha falta
No sé tú

No sé tú
Pero yo te busco en cada amanecer
Mis deseos no los puedo contener
En las noches cuando duermo
Sin imsomnio yo me enfermo
Me haces falta mucha falta
No sé tú

""La Bikina""

Solitaria camina la bikina
La gente se pone a murmurar
Dicen que tiene una pena
Dicen que tiene una pena que la hace llorar

Altanera preciosa y orgullosa
No permite la quieran consolar
Pasa luciendo su real majestad
Pasas caminas nos miras sin vernos jamás

La bikina
Tiene pena y dolor
La bikina
No conoce el amor

Altanera preciosa y orgullosa
No permite la quieran consolar
Dicen que alguien ya vino y se fue
Dicen que pasa las noches llorando por él

¡Mi Mariachi!

La bikina
Tiene pena y dolor
La bikina
No conoce el amor

Altanera preciosa y orgullosa
No permite la quieran consolar
Dicen que alguien ya vino y se fue
Dicen que pasa las noches llorando por él

Lyrics:

I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two or three times in a row,
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.",TRUE,TRUE,836260550

I’m one of one
I’m number one 
I’m the only one
Don't even waste your time
Trying to compete with me 
No one else in this world can think like me 
I'm twisted  
I’ll contradict it
Keep him addicted 
Lies on his lips, I lick it  
  
Unique 
That’s what you are 
Stilettos kicking vintage crystal off the bar 
Category  
Bad bitch
I’m the bar 
Alien Superstar
Whip, whip

I’m too classy for this world 
Forever I’m that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls 
Ooh baby I'm
Too classy to be touched 
I paid them all in dust
I’m stingy with my love

Ooh baby I’m
U-N-I-Q-U-E
Oh I’m stingy with my love
Ooh baby I’m
U-N-I-Q-U-E
Oh I’m stingy with my love

Unicorn is the uniform you put on
Eyes on you when you perform
Eyes on I when I put on
Mastermind their haute couture
Label whores can’t clock I’m so obscure 
Masterpiece genius, drip intravenous
Patty cake on that wrist 
Tiffany blue billboards over that ceiling 
We don’t like plain
Always dreamed of paper planes 
Mile high when I rodeo
Then I come down and take off again
You see pleasure in my glare 
Look over my shoulder and you ain’t scared 
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow hike it in the air

I’m too classy for this world 
Forever I’m that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls 
Ooh baby I'm too classy to be touched 
I paid them all in dust
I’m stingy with my love

Ooh baby
U-N-I-Q-U-E
U-N-I-Q-U-E

I got pearls beneath my legs my lips my hands my hips 
I got diamonds beneath my thighs where his ego will find bliss 
Can’t find an ocean deep that can compete with this cinnamon kiss 
Fire beneath your feet 
Music when you speak you’re so 
Unique

That’s what you are 
Lingerie reflecting off the mirror on the bar 
Category 
Sexy bitch, I’m the bar  
Alien superstar

We just reaching out to the solar
System, we flying over
Bullshit we flying over  
Supernatural love up in the air
I just talk my shit Casanova
Superstar, supernova
Power pull ‘em in closer
If that’s your man then why he over here?

Lyrics:

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a real work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
(chorus)
Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.
You're the one that gives your all.

On stage rockin’ I’m stir crazy 
Cocoa flow like 1980’s
Come let’s tell a drop lazy
None of that maybe 
Energy, energy, energy 

Just vibe
Voting out 45, don’t get outta line
Pick a side
Only double lines we cross is dollars signs
Hold up 
Wait, I hear you just got paid make it rain
Energy

She more Cancun he more Saint Tropez
Big wave in the room and the crowd gon’ move
Look around everybody on mute
Look around it’s me and my crew
Big energy

He was on stop mode 
Got froze 
Froze front page vogue 
No pose
Chat too much full clip unload 
That’s that Kodak energy 
Energy, energy, energy

Gold links, raw denim
You know that we do it grande
You know that I’m gon’ be extra
When that camera go pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Keep ‘em waiting like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
Ooo la la la  
That’s the way dem boys sound when I walk through the block, block, block
Then I uzi that doozy shot, shot, shot

We was just chillin’ minding our business
Popping our pain and champagne though the ceiling
Sipping it up, flicking it up
All this good energy got you all in your feelings, feelings
I’m crazy, I’m swearing, I’m daring, your man’s staring
I just entered the country with derringers
Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists

He was on stop mode 
Got froze 
Froze front page vogue 
No pose
Chat too much full clip unload 
That’s that Kodak energy 
Energy, energy, energy

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Con Calma Letra:
Cómo te llamas baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa’ mi
Dile a tus amigas que andamos ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party

Cómo te llamas baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa’ mi
Dile a tus amigas que andamos ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party

Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom poom” girl
es una asesina cuando baila quiero que to’ el mundo la vea
I like your “poom poom” girl 
Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom pomm” girl
Tiene adrenalina en medio de la pista vente hazme lo que sea
I like your “poom poom” girl 

Ya vi que estás solita acompáñame
La noche es de nosotros tú lo sabes
Que ganas me dan dan dan
De guayarte mami ese rampampam! Yeah!
Esa criminal como lo mueve es un delito
Tengo que arrestarte porque empiezo y no me quito
Tienes criminality pero te doy fatality
Vívete la película flotando en mi gravity
Daddy pone las reglas tienes que obedecer
Mami no tiene pausa qué es lo que vas hacer?
Échale échale échale pa’ tras
Échale échale  pa’ lante y pa’ tras

Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom poom” girl
es una asesina cuando baila quiere que to’ el mundo la vea
I like your “poom poom” girl 
Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom pomm” girl
Tiene adrenalina en medio de la pista vente hazme lo que sea
I like your “poom poom” girl 

Tú tienes candela y yo tengo la vela
Llama al 911 se están quemando las suelas
Me daña cuando la faldita esa me la modela
Mami estás enferma pero tu show no lo cancelas
Te llaman a ti la reina del party
Mucha sandunga tiene ese body
Tírate un paso no no pare wow dale dale!
Somos dos bandidos entre la rumba y romance
Zúmbale dj otra vez pa’ que dance
Échale échale échale pa’ tras
Échale échale pa’ lante y pa’ tras

Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom poom” girl
es una asesina cuando baila quiere que to’ el mundo la vea
I like your “poom poom” girl 
Con calma yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese “poom pomm” girl

Lyrics
I finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it (uh-uh)
You be on my back like a cardigan (cardigan)
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend (call her again)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (evidence)
It's evident that you ready to rock (ready to rock)
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side (pride to the side)
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide (ready to hide)
Swangin' on the corner, bang my TEC 'til it pop (TEC 'til it pop)
I thought I was a goner, blaze to your honour
Burn marijuana, teeth diamond designer
Hotter than the sauna, I met her at Salata
Bought lil' baby Prada, she popped it for the dollar
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (needed some help)
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (needed some help)
I'm finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it (uh-uh)
You be on my back like a cardigan (cardigan)
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend (call her again)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (evidence)
It's evident that you ready to rock (ready to rock)
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side (pride to the side)
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide (ready to hide)

Official “Honest” Lyrics:

Honest (honest)
Your modest
I like it (I like it)
You stay down
And you the baddest (baddest) 
Find you in the cut
I copped it (I copped it)

Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (from jump)
It’s 23 when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that’s your song (and that’s your song)

Off top you the sun in my morning 
I tried to get away but its boring 
You’re my safe haven
I need it all alone
And you my dime piece
And I can’t take less than one

You the (whew)
You the one
Trinity you like three in one 
Ratio ten to one

You get spicy
I like that cajun on you 
On occasion
That’s your testimony

I like that hazel on you
I look straight in your eyes 
Holy matrimony

Honest (honest)
Your modest
I like it (I like it)
You stay down
And you the baddest (baddest) Find you in the cut
I copped it (copped it)

Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (from jump)
It’s 23 when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that’s your song (and that’s your song)

Yeah honest
Spicy I like it
Facetime me the weed I just might buy it
Throw it back on the couch I just might try (Ohhhh spicy) 
Damn that booty thick
I like it
Hey Justin B
I know you don’t do this often 
But this here sneak and geek 
Fuck that Mclaren
Im ridin the jeep
I got in the club with all of my thugs
Im packing that pistol Pete
Better watch your mouth
Gotta pick a side before you jump and leap
I was selling thee nickels and dimes in dubs 
But crack in my sock it ain’t me
But baby I like it
Imma pull that double R to your crib just for once 
It’s 23 when you get dunked 
Me and JB smokin skunk

Oh honest
Honest (honest)
Your modest
I like it (I like it)
You stay down
And you the baddest (baddest) 
Find you in the cut
I copped it (I copped it)

Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (from jump)
It’s 23 when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that’s your song (and that’s your song) Oh honest

Lyrics to Mystery Lady
Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.
We can do like anything you want I’m amazing
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya check my catalogue.
Verse 1
In this life I come across fans and hoes and I like to give my fans a rose curse of the talented everywhere I go
they wanna change clothes and pose
But my wife be in my dreams bruh no I couldn’t see her
I saw her silhouette.
I know I can make her wet but when I wake up alone
I just break out my phone
Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong
am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.
We can do like anything you want I’m amazing
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya check my catalogue.
Verse 2 [Don Toliver]
Thinkin I could make this many songs about My lady she be havin me up and down
I be in my feelings, sometimes I be jealous But I keep it thuggin like It’s Macavelli
Ring ring hit my celly
Remember you went bad on me I won't forget it. You say that you gon tell on me
No don’t you tell it
In between the sheets you know i got you Yellin

Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.
We can do like anything you want I’m amazing
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya check my catalogue.
Verse 3
Could it be monogamy ain’t meant for me nah
that’s way too Reckless I’d get too jealous
could she be from the east or overseas nah
I learned my lesson I’m way to Western could she be my favorite ethnicity I’m just I’m undressing all of these sections of my thoughts
thinkin thinkin thinkin thinkin too hard
but I really wanna know
Thinking I could make this many songs ‘bout A Lady, when I haven’t met her,
But she on me heavy.
On my cerebellum.
IfIsayIloveheramIwrong am I crazy, am I over zealous I just know the feeling And I’m never wrong
Swear that I’ve been gifted with a song And a medley
it’s intoxicating
It weigh on you heavy
Like the alcohol.
We can do like anything you want I’m amazing
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya check my catalogue.

Letra:

Si por cosas del destino
Un día tú y yo nos despedimos
Ay, yo no sé qué comería
O de qué me reiría
Porque el mundo sin ti no me lo imagino

Si por cosas de la vida
Llega el hombre que por fin te merecías
Y si él es tu alma gemela
Yo me quito aunque me duela
Y hasta dos o tres consejos le daría

No te preocupes por mí
Yo me las arreglaría
Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía
Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti

Y aunque te den el doble de caricias
Y el triple de los besos que te di
Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día
Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti
Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero
Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad
De lo que yo a ti te quiero

No te preocupes por mí
Yo me las arreglaría
Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía
Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti

Y aunque te den el doble de caricias
Y el triple de los besos que te di
Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día
Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti
Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero
Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad
De lo que yo a ti te quiero
De lo que yo a ti te quiero

LETRA: 

Desconocidos
Sí, sí

Apenas somos dos, desconocidos 
Con ganas de besarse
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase 
Apenas somos dos, desconocidos 
Con miedo a enamorarse
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Oye oye óyeme bien 
Tú eres lo que busco yo en una mujer 
Te tengo en la mira desde que llegué
Siento que eres mía, yo no sé por qué

Ay, yo sé que es mentira 
Decir que soy el hombre de tu vida 
Si tú ayer no me conocías 
Y no sabías que me querías

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

¡Y la bailamos lentico!

No sé cómo explicar 
Lo que en ti estoy viendo 
Me encanta cómo estás moviéndote 
Tu cuerpo estrella contra mi cuerpo ma

No lo entiendo 
Dime si de mí te estabas escondiendo 
Té tan bella y yo apenas conociéndote 
Bailemos sin importar quién este viendo

Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo 
Yo quiero pasarla bien contigo, contigo 
Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo 
Y ver el amanecer contigo, contigo

Apenas somos dos desconocidos
Con ganas de besarse (Con miedo a enamorarse) 
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase 
Apenas somos dos, desconocidos 
Con miedo a enamorarse (Con ganas de besarse) 
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase

Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Si quieres después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Ay, vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Y si quieres después nos enamoramos
Ay, vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, que la cagamos

Lyrics: 

Me dicen aeropuerto porque te pongo a viajar,
Me dicen gimnasio porque te pongo a sudar,
Me dicen fin de año porque te pongo a beber,
Quiero cuadrarme contigo y que digan que soy tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Lo siento por los que están en la fila,
Que recojan y empaquen mochila,
Diles que ya te dejen tranquila,
Que yo soy tuyo y tú eres mía.

Agarremo un avión sin saber pa donde,
Busquemos una playa sin tiburones,
Tú y yo besándonos en los rincones,
Y que se vea el mar desde los balcones.

Tengo la lancha alquilada,
Coquito y agua salada,
Dos trajes de baño, dos cervecitas y más nada,
Más nada.

Tengo la lancha alquilada,
Coquito y agua salada,
Dos trajes de baño, dos cervecitas y más nada.

Me dicen aeropuerto porque te pongo a viajar,
Me dicen gimnasio porque te pongo a sudar,
Me dicen fin de año porque te pongo a beber,
Quiero cuadrarme contigo y que digan que soy tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Si tú estás a lado mío yo no dejaré que nada te destruya, te destruya,
Siete billones de sonrisas en el mundo y a mí me gusta la tuya, solo la tuya.
Lo que siento ya es muy obvio,
El mundo sin ti lo odio,
Y yo creo que ya es notorio, 
que yo quiero ser tu novio.

Me dicen aeropuerto porque te pongo a viajar,
Me dicen gimnasio porque te pongo a sudar,
Me dicen fin de año porque te pongo a beber,
Quiero cuadrarme contigo y que digan que soy tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé,
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Que me digan que soy tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.
Tu bebé, tu bebé, tu bebé.

Letra de «Si Me Dices Que Sí»

(Lara mercy gang)
(For you my love)

Qué pasa si te digo 
Que yo no te he olvidado
Que no aprendí a vivir sin ti

(Reik)

Qué pasa si esta noche
Jugamos al pasado
Para curar la cicatriz

(Camilo)

¿Qué no daría por besar tu cuello?
¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(Wo)
Es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wa yo, wa yey)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Uh, oh)
Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Lara mercy gang)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Farru)
Si me dices que sí

Tu boca se acuerda 
De mí si la toco
Mi mente no olvida 
Y mi cuerpo tampoco
Tú me enseñaste a amarte
Pero nunca a olvidarte

Dime qué voy a hacer 
Para que tú te quedes aquí
(Eh, eh)
(Dime qué hago)

Si no eres tú no es nadie
(Wu, oh, uh, oh)

Y es así
(Y es así)
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Si no estás me muero)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir
(Ya no quiero vivir)

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
Yo dejo todo por ti
(Uh, oh)
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Lara mercy gang)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Si me dices que sí

Te compro Richard Mille
Te regalo una casa ahí en Beverly Hills 
Pa’ vivi’no’ la movie flow Nicki MeekMilly
Como la serie del patrón somo’ El Topo y El Chili
Inseparables, cómplices apasionados en placer 
Si te lograra convencer 
Para que volvieras otra vez

Y dime que no
Lánzame un sí camuflajeado
Clávame una duda
Y me quedaré a tu lado

¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(¡Farru!)

Y es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wai oh, wah yeh)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Wuo)

Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Si me dices que sí)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(Yeah)
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Qué no daría por besar tu cuello
Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

Lyrics: 

De lejos se ve que tiene el corazón roto,
Yo con solo mirarla lo noto,
Si pa ayudarla hay que anotarse, me anoto,
Yo estoy pa usted, me declaro devoto.

Dígame por qué una bebe como usted no se ve feliz,
Y anda por ahí bebiendo sola, 
Y por la calle a estas horas.
Dígame por qué trae los ojos así,
Quién la hizo llorar, quién la hizo sufrir,
Ay! dígame ahora,
Que yo no la dejo sola.

Ella ahora tiene el corazón hecho pedazos,
Si quieres llorar en mis hombros, te hacen falta brazos, yo te los doy.
Amores como el tuyo están escasos,
Siempre la trato con respeto nunca me propaso,
Sus llamadas no rechazo,
Cupido tiene mala puntería en los flechazos, 
Donde lo vea por ahí le meto un derechazo,
Yo contigo me caso,
Pero estoy consciente que hay que llevarlo paso a paso.
Por ti yo soy capaz de lo no creen, yo te lo demostré, 
Un comportamiento extraño yo le note,
Se reveló con una foto, esa no es usted,
Yo hasta me preocupé.

Dígame por qué una bebe como usted no se ve feliz,
Y anda por ahí bebiendo sola, 
Y por la calle a estas horas.
Dígame por qué trae los ojos así,
Quién la hizo llorar, quién la hizo sufrir,
Ay! dígame ahora,
Que yo no la dejo sola.

Yo se que usted trae broncas con cupido,
Pero no cierre el cora se lo pido,
Usted quiere olvidarlo y no ha podido,
Y ya intentó con todo pero no intentó conmigo.
Hazme caso, relájate en mis brazos,
Que yo te propongo olvidar a ese payaso,
Y si te gusta el arte, aquí te va un Picasso, Muah!

Dígame por qué una bebe como usted no se ve feliz,
Y anda por ahí bebiendo sola, 
Y por la calle a estas horas.
Dígame por qué trae los ojos así,
Quién la hizo llorar, quién la hizo sufrir,
Ay! dígame ahora,
Que yo no la dejo sola.

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

This is the remix
Y me traje a Camilo

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu…

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo…
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tú….

Ra’ Rauw

Yo no se ni que hacer (no se)
Cuando estoy cerca de ti
Tus ojos color café
Se apoderaron de mi
Muero por un beso 
De esos que no son de amigos (de esos que no son de amigos)
Me di cuenta que por esa sonrisa yo vivo
 
Camilo
Yo quiero conocerte…
Como nadie te conoce
Dime que me quieres
Pa’ ponerlo en altas voces
Pa’ mostrarte que yo soy tuyo
En las costillas me tatúo…
Tu nombre….

¿Que lo que tienes?
Yo no se
Que me mata y no se porque…
Muéstrame ese tatua'ito secreto que no se ve
Porque tu, tu 
Con ese tattoo, tu
Ta’ pa’ comerte 
Toda, todita bebé (hehe) (todita)

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu… (así estas tu)

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo…
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tu….

Tu… (tu, tu, tu, tu..)
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu… (así estas tu)

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo… (ese tattoo)
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tu…. (no hace fata nada, bebe)

Dice, ey

Es que yo no quiero mas nadie 
Que no seas tu en mi cama
Baby, cuando te despiertes
Levántame antes que te vayas
Solo tu boca es lo que desayuno
Siempre aprovecho el momento oportuno
Como yo no hay ninguno
Déjame ser tu número uno

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte
Toda, todita
Así estas tu…

Te ves tan rica
Esa carita y ese tattoo…
Ay, haces que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada, 
Si estas tu…. (no hace falta nada, nada) (asi estas tu, baby)

Tu…
Estas pa’ comerte

#EltonJohn #BritneySpears #HoldMeCloser
This stunning dance video for Hold Me Closer, shot in Mexico City by the award winning director Tanu Muino beautifully capturing an immeasurable feeling of intimacy so missing from the world through the turmoil and chaos of recent times.
Tanu said, ""This was an emotional one for me as I grew up with Britney. After seeing ""Slave For You,"" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, ""Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.""

Ra’ Rauw
¿Cómo le puedo hacer?
Pa’ convencerte 
A solas quiero tenerte…

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar

Farru!
Desde que te vi yo sabía
Que tú ibas a ser mía
Y algo a mí me decía
Que tú eres la baby que tanto quería…

Porque rápido hubo química 
Y te vi tan simpática 
Te miraba tan exótica 
Que rápido te jale pa’ca (briba, ba, ba, baiii)

Y gozamos, bebimos, fumamos
Bailamos to’a la noche y en casa terminamos
Todavía no sé cómo se llama
Y tampoco sé cómo terminamos en mi cama

Pero tuvimos química 
Y te vi tan simpática 
Te miraba tan exótica 
Que rápido te jale pa’ca (briba, ba, ba)

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar (uoo)

To’as las cosas que pasan por mi mente
En mi habitación, mujer…
Yo dándote
Que llegue el proceso de tu traje yo subir
Dame tus besos que son hechos para mí
Yo calentándote,
Tú calentándome,
Tú dices que tú eres brava, eso lo quiero ver…

Que llegue el proceso de tu traje yo subir
Dame tus besos que son hechos para mí
Sigue bailándome,
Sigue cucándome,
Que te voy a dar duro contra la pared

¿Cómo le puedo hacer?
Pa’ convencerte 
A solas quiero tenerte…

¿Qué tú harás si te digo?
Mis fantasías contigo
Susurrado al oído
Te comienzas a calentar…

Tú me dices y nos vamos
¿Qué nosotros esperamos?
Si los dos nos gustamos 
Y las miradas no lo pueden negar

Lyrics:

I’m sorry but
Don’t wanna talk
I need a moment before i go
It`s nothing personal

I draw the blinds
They don’t need to see me cry
Cause even when they understand
They don’t understand

So then when I’m finished
I’m all ‘bout my business
And ready to save the world
I’m takin my misery
Make it my bitch
Can’t be everyone’s favourite girl

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

Lo siento mucho, pero me voy
Por que a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tu no vez que lo Hago por que te amo

Pero ya, no tengo mas na' que hacer aquí
Me voy, llego la hora de partir
En mi propio camino seguiré lejos de ti

So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way

Letra de «Si Me Dices Que Sí»

(Lara mercy gang)
(For you my love)

Qué pasa si te digo 
Que yo no te he olvidado
Que no aprendí a vivir sin ti

(Reik)

Qué pasa si esta noche
Jugamos al pasado
Para curar la cicatriz

(Camilo)

¿Qué no daría por besar tu cuello?
¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(Wo)
Es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wa yo, wa yey)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Uh, oh)
Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Lara mercy gang)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
(Farru)
Si me dices que sí

Tu boca se acuerda 
De mí si la toco
Mi mente no olvida 
Y mi cuerpo tampoco
Tú me enseñaste a amarte
Pero nunca a olvidarte

Dime qué voy a hacer 
Para que tú te quedes aquí
(Eh, eh)
(Dime qué hago)

Si no eres tú no es nadie
(Wu, oh, uh, oh)

Y es así
(Y es así)
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Si no estás me muero)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir
(Ya no quiero vivir)

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
Yo dejo todo por ti
(Uh, oh)
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Lara mercy gang)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Si me dices que sí

Te compro Richard Mille
Te regalo una casa ahí en Beverly Hills 
Pa’ vivi’no’ la movie flow Nicki MeekMilly
Como la serie del patrón somo’ El Topo y El Chili
Inseparables, cómplices apasionados en placer 
Si te lograra convencer 
Para que volvieras otra vez

Y dime que no
Lánzame un sí camuflajeado
Clávame una duda
Y me quedaré a tu lado

¿Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho?
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

(¡Farru!)

Y es así
Si yo no tengo tus besos
Yo me puedo morir
(Wai oh, wah yeh)
Si tú te alejas de mí
Ya no quiero vivir

Si desde lejos se nota 
Que ya no eres feliz
(Wuo)

Yo dejo todo por ti
Si me dices que sí

(¿A quién engañas?)
(Si me dices que sí)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)

Si me dices que sí
(Yeah)
(¿A quién engañas?)
(Wuo)
(Tú no eres feliz sin mí)
Si me dices que sí

Qué no daría por besar tu cuello
Qué no daría por oler tu pelo
Mientras te me duermes en el pecho
Daría todo por volver el tiempo

Letra:

Sé
Que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar,
Que estás cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar
Girando siempre en un lugar

Sé
Que las ventanas se pueden abrir,
Cambiar el aire depende de ti…
Te ayudará, Vale la pena una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda,
Quitarnos los miedo, dejarlos afuera…
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más el presente que el futuro,
Dale suave que aquí no hay apuro
Ya salimos adelante, ya no le des mente
Y abrazo pa´ toda mi gente.

É melhor perder-se que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
E assim será
E a vida muda, mudará.

Sé
Que en lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá y así será
La vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más.

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, echarlos pa fuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza,
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos, sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro
con el corazón

Lyrics:
Adios madre mía
Échame la bendición
Perdón por esta agonia
Que causé a tu corazón
Dobla rodillas por mí
Rézale a dios por mí
Que tenga misericordia
Por la vida que escogí
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido
Cuatro de la madrugada entran le rompen la puerta
A la vieja con una orden de arresto
Agentes enmascarados con el chaleco puesto
“Señora entregue a su hijo, ¿O prefiere verlo muerto?”
Mi madre confundida estalla en llanto
Pide misericordia en medio del quebranto
Yo nunca había visto a mami llorar
Pero aun así no paraba de rezar
Al verla así, mis manos levanté
No lo pensé y de una me entregué
Yo le gritaba “¡Madre perdóneme,
Esto no se lo merece usted!”
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido
Yo tenía un mal presentimiento
De que algo mal iba a salir
Y antes de salir de casa
A mi viejita le pedí
Dobla rodillas por mí
Rézale a dios por mí
Que tenga misericordia
Por la vida que escogí
Salgo entregao’ puesto pa la vuelta
Si damo’ este palo me toca el 50
La cara tapá’ me enganché la 40
Por si algo sale mal le vacío el de 30
Toy viendo dimareo, una movida rara
Ya mate al contacto porque no nos da la cara
Detras viene una patrulla y si viene y nos para
“Mi libertad no tiene precio, dispara” Para-ra-ra-rapae!
Suenan los fules
Llegan los azules
Tabala tanta sangre no había visto
Si salimos vivos de aquí es gracias a Cristo
Por fin lo conseguimos a base de palos
De donde venimos nadie nos daba la mano
La cara tapada nos encapuchamos
Confío en el de arriba que nunca me ha traicionado
En mi coro no hay chivato’, yeh
Con Los Fedes no hicimos trato
En la calle tengo un contrato’ yeh
Siempre real y nunca sapo, nunca sapo Yeiyeeh
En el coro si hay un chivato
Que con Los Fedes hizo un trato
Por mi cabeza hay un contrato
No son real estos son sapo, estos son sapos
En el barrio donde vivo
Me vinieron a buscar
Mamá, habla con el juez
Que me de la libertad
En el patio de la carcel
Hay un charco y no ha llovido
Son las lagrimas de un preso
Que ha entrado y no ha salido

Lyrics:
El Rvssian

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me Convenciste
Que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 

Tu mirada no es confiable
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo 

I’m tryna keep you warm
Quarentining with me for no reason 
Love drunk got me floored
Left your Chanel bag in my Porsche 
I shoulda dropped you off
Memories we repeat every weekend
Lie like this before
You do me when you get bored 
It ain’t no problem 
It’s cool what you doing tonight 
Long as you keep coming and I’m fucking you right
Lil mami amor
Another chance for me to give you what’s yours
And I know that it’s bad
When I let you pull me right back 
Cause you never promise tomorrow 
You give me your love but it’s borrowed 
Lay you down and forget all the past 
Only one that could do me like that 
How you coming and goin is tidal 
You wrapped on my body but I know

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 

Baby se acabo 
Te corté de raíz ahora dónde ponerte decido yo 
Que se muera mi flor 
Difícil me la puso 
Acabo de ver en mi carro que su cartera se quedó
A propósito la dejó 
Siempre pone una excusa pa volverme a ver 
Después que peleamos me lo quiere hacer 
Con solo un beso se me olvidó 
Todo lo que ella me hizo 

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me convenciste 
que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 
Tu mirada no es confiable 
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo

Said the heart's all over the world tonight

Ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure,
Yes, you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours,
You're a class all your own
And
Oh, little cutie
When you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops
You're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and...

You mean to me
What I mean to you and
Together baby,
There is nothing we won't do.
'Cause if I got you,
I don't need money,
I don't need cars,
Girl, you're my all.

Lyrics: 
[Intro]
Yeah, word to Mazii, n*gga (ah)
F*ck these n*ggas talkin' 'bout, n*gga?
Haha
When they swing that way to the right, you swing to the left, you heard?

[Verse]
Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, f*cking your ho in her kidney
F*ck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck and my wrist and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his b*tch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she's f*cking on my brozay
I'm just gon' f*ck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler kick it
F*cked that lil bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, f*ck that b*tch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, b*tch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted
But then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
B*tch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me p*ssy, I need a percentage
If you gon' f*ck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy (Woo, woo, woo)

[Outro]
I ain't been broke in a minute, damn (Woo)
I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo, woo, woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn

Lyrics: 

I'm not tryna be here for a long time
Just, just a good, good time
I got a lot of shit weighin' on my mind
Weighin' on my mind

So f*ckin' serious, you ni*gas' delirious
Said it wit' exclamation, but ni*gas can't f*ck wit' me, period
B*tch, right off the back, I need y'all to flex
All of this stuntin' look good for my ex
All of these zeros look good on my checks
I got like two or three phones for business and b*tches and still can't even answer a text
Yeah, we in the spot, we won't give it a rest
They be sayin' that that liquor gon' catch up to you
N*gga, it ain't caught up to me yet
I hit the road, I look like the mayor
Countin' up fifties and twentiеs and tens
I'm out of state, they givе me a ten
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
That was the plan again, b*tch, I'm the man again
Walk out of Louis, it look like a mannequin
All the store management wanna know how much I spend, I spend, yeah
I don't f*ck wit' her, she fiesty
All of the n*ggas that's wit' me are shiesty
This is the reason these n*ggas don't like me, yeah
I gotta win, I gotta hit from the back when it's pricy
I gotta fly out the trappers to sight-see
She wanna f*ck wit' a R&B singer
I hit her, I ducked her, I sent her to Nyce B
I'm on a roll like the motherf*ckin' dice be
I'm catchin' p*ssy like I'm Jerry Rice
I'm catchin' p*ssy like it was a flight
I'm in your city, what's up for the night?

I, I've had way too much to drink, you know, I
1942, it ain't on me, sing to five
Ex callin' up my phone, f*ckin' up the vibe
Tonight's not the night, tonight's not the—
Yeah (Yeah), f*ck that b*tch, yeah (Uh)
Hop on the couch, yeah (Yeah), take me a flick, yeah (Uh)
Louis V belt, yeah (Yeah), Louis V belt, yeah (Uh)
F*ck that b*tch, yeah (Yeah)
Hop on the couch, yeah (Yeah), take me a flick (Woah), yeah (Yeah)

The album contains a contemporary holiday theme, and featured ""authentic, gospel flavored background vocals."" Three singles were released from the album, of which All I Want for Christmas Is You went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time.

Lyrics:
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping

Lyrics:
No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

Lyrics:
Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error, pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the Angels' voices
Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear, hear the Angels' voices
Oh, night divine, yeah, oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

Oh, night divine
Oh, night divine
Oh, night divine

Sapnon ki chaahat hai
Jin sapnon ko sach
Ho jaane ki aadat hai

Lyrics:

MUKHDA
Mujhko itna bataaye koi
Kaise tujh se dil no lagaaye koi

Rabba ne tujhko banaane mein
Kar di hain husn ki ख़ाली tijoriyaan
 
Kaajal ki 
Siyaahi se likhi 
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan 

[ Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

ANTARA
पतझड़ ke mausam mein bhi
रंगी chanaaron jaisi
Jhanke sannaaton mein tu
Veena (वीना) ke taaron jaisi

Sadiyon se bhi Iambi ye
Man ki amaavasein hain
Aur to phuljhadiyon vaale
Tyohaaron jaisi ..

Chanda bhi deevaana hai tera
Jalti hain tujhse
Saari chakoriyaan 

Kaajal ki
Siyaahi se likhi
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan

[Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

Song Lyrics :

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Ho Feel me 
Shining in the shed in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and heal me, O Heal me 

Thinking about the love n making The Life for sharing 
Come and feel me O feel me 
Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Come on Heal me.. 

Hua Jo tu bhi mera Mera, Tera Jo ikrarr hua 
To kyun na mein bhi, Keh dun keh dun 
Hua mujhe bhi Pyaar hua 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, O Feel me 
Shining in the shade in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and Heal me.. O Heal me.. 
umm waise to maan mera 
Phele bhi raaton mein 

Aksar hi chahat ke haan, Sapne Sanjota tha 
Phele bhi dhadkan yeh, Dhoonn koi gaati thi 
Par abb jo hota hai who, Phele na hota tha 
Hoona hai Tujhe jo bhi jo bhi 
Mujhe bhi is paar hua

To kyun na main bhi keh doon keh doon 
hoona mujhe bhi pyaar hua
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 

Aankhon se chhoon lu k baahein tarasti hain 
Dil ne pukaara hai haan, Ab to Chale aao 
Aao k Shabnam ki Bundein Barasti hain 
Mausam Ishaara hai haan... 
Ab to Chale aao!!
Baahon mein Daale Baahein Baahein 
Baahon ka Jaise haar hoona.. 
Haan Maana maine maana maana... 
hoona mujhe bhi pyaar hoona 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 
Tera hone laga hoon, Khone Laga hoon 
Jab se mila hoon 

Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Haan Feel me 
Shining in the sand in sun like a pearl up on the ocean 
Come and feel me, Haan Feel me 
Thinking about the love n making entire Life for sharing 
Come and feel me, Ho Heal me

Ye raaste .. ye raaste

Tu hai havaon ka jhonka main aag hoon
Tu raagdaari hai meri main raag hoon

Main jee raha hoon tere intezar mein
Aavaaz de .. aavaaz de

Lyrics:
MALE
Mera darpan ankhiyaan teri 
Tujhko tarsein ratiyaan meri

Jeena mujhko raas aane laga
Jabse chehkeen batiyaan teri

Jogan tera maara rasiya
Jag jeeeta dil haara rasiya
Pag tere chaubaare thehre
Sadqe main banjaara rasiya

Rasiya ..
Ye tera hua tune jiya moh liya

Rasiya ..
Ne tera hai jo vahi tujhe saunp diya


ANTARA 

FEMALE 
Mera sarmaaya hai tu
Tera sarmaaya hun main

MALE
Aaja mujhe seench de
Murjhaaya hun main

FEMALE 
Jaise mera daaman hai tu
Aur teri chhaaya hun main

MALE
Tabhi tera baavra
Kehlaaya hun main

Teri baahon mein ho ke
Lagta hai ke zameen pe
Jannat sach mein agar kahin hai

FEMALE 
Yahin hai ..

MALE
Ban kar tera yaara rasiya
Soche naa dobaara rasiya

Pag tere chaubaare thehre
Sadqe main banjaara rasiya

Rasiya ..
Ye tera hua tune jiya moh liya

Rasiya ..
Ne tera hai jo vahi tujhe saunp diya

It was released as a single in 1980 with ""Hey You"" as the B-side. The music was composed by guitarist David Gilmour, and lyrics were written by bassist Roger Waters.

The Wall is a concept album about an embittered and alienated rock star named Pink. In ""Comfortably Numb,"" Pink is medicated by a doctor so he can perform for a show.

Guitarist David Gilmour recorded a wordless demo, and bassist Roger Waters wrote lyrics, inspired by an experience of being injected with tranquilizers for stomach cramps before a 1977 performance in Philadelphia on the In the Flesh Tour. ""That was the longest two hours of my life,"" Waters said, ""trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm."" The song's working title was ""The Doctor"".

For the chorus, Gilmour and session player Lee Ritenour used a pair of acoustic guitars strung similarly to Nashville tuning, but with the low E string replaced with a high E string, two octaves higher than standard tuning. This tuning was also used for the arpeggios in ""Hey You"".

Waters and Gilmour disagreed about how to record the song; Gilmour preferred a more grungy style for the verses. Gilmour said: ""We argued over 'Comfortably Numb' like mad. Really had a big fight, went on for ages."" In the end, Waters' preferred opening and Gilmour's final solo were used.[citation needed]

To write the two guitar solos, Gilmour pieced together elements from several other solos he had been working on, marking his preferred segments for the final take.

**50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PINK FLOYD‘S ‘THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON’. OUT MARCH 24**
Announcing the release of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ as a deluxe box set to celebrate 50 years since the release of one of the best-selling albums of all time. Newly remastered, the box set will be released on 24th March 2023. 

One of the most iconic and influential albums ever, Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ continues to find new audiences globally. The album was partly developed during live performances, and the band premiered an early version of the suite at London’s Rainbow Theatre several months before recording began. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ is the eighth studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in the US on 1 March and then in the UK on 16th March 1973.  The new material was recorded in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road studios) in London. The iconic sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis and drawn by George Hardie. ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.

The new deluxe box set includes CD and gatefold vinyl of the new 2023 remastered studio album and Blu-Ray + DVD audio featuring the original 5.1 mix and remastered stereo versions.  The set also includes additional new Blu-ray disc of Atmos mix plus CD and LP of ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’. For full details see listing below.

**'THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON - LIVE AT WEMBLEY EMPIRE POOL, LONDON, 1974’**
Simultaneously, on 24th March, the CD and first ever vinyl issue of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974’ will be released independently. It was originally recorded in November 1974 as part of the band’s winter tour and this is the first time it will be available as a stand-alone album, with artwork featuring an original 1973 line-drawn cover by George Hardie.

**ANIMATED VIDEO COMPETITION**
The 50th Anniversary release will also be celebrated as Pink Floyd invite a new generation of animators to enter a competition to create music videos for any of the 10 songs on the iconic 1973 album. Pink Floyd has a rich history of collaborating with animators from the beginnings of the band (Ian Emes, Gerald Scarfe etc.), and in some cases the visuals that accompany the songs have become synonymous with the music itself. The 50th Anniversary will be no exception. The band would like to give all animators an opportunity to present a fresh take on these timeless aural works. Animators can enter up to 10 videos, one per song on the album. A winner will be selected from a panel of experts which will include Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason, Aubrey 'Po' Powell (Pink Floyd's creative director) and the BFI (British Film Institute). The deadline for submissions is November 30th 2023. To enter and for more information go to https://www.pinkfloyd.com/competition/

**PINK FLOYD - THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON: 50TH ANNIVERSARY BOOK**
The book Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon: 50th Anniversary will also be published separately by Thames & Hudson on March 24, 2023 to coincide with the box set release. Curated by photographer Jill Furmanovsky and art directed by Hipgnosis co-founder Aubrey Powell, this LP-sized volume showcases rare and previously unseen photographs taken during The Dark Side Of The Moon tours of 1972-1975 and was created with the involvement of the band members.

**NEW PLANETARIUM ALBUM EXPERIENCE ANNOUNCED**
Fifty years on, in recognition of the iconic album and with the help of huge strides in technology, an official full dome experience with stunning visuals of the solar system and beyond and played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon, will be released in Planetariums around the world in March. Contact your local Planetarium for any screening details.

The show itself will be divided between the 10 tracks off the album, in chronological order, each having a different theme; some futuristically looking forward and some a retro acknowledgment to Pink Floyd’s visual history, all relating to a time and space experience, embracing up to the minute technology that only a Planetarium can offer. It promises to be immersive; an all-encompassing surround sound and visual treat that will transcend reality and take you way beyond the realms of 2D experience.

Lyrics: 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

Lyrics: 
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

#GreenDay #Nimrod25 #GoodRiddanceTimeOfYourLife

Lyrics: 
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life...

Lyrics: 
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends...

Lyrics: 
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Lyrics: 
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

Lyrics: 
Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Lyrics: 
Say hey!
Cha

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Three, four!
""The representative from California has the floor.""
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
And kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

Lyrics: 
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My senses dulled
Passed the point of delirium
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

Jaded:

Somebody keep my balance
I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression

The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium

Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die!
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere
In nowhere

In A Time Lapse is the representation of the bringing together all of life's experience and emotions into a single moment of time. Recorded in a remote monastery near Verona and written over a period of 2 years it is as Epic and emotional as Divenire and as experimental and adventurous as Nightbook

 Underwater, Einaudi's first full solo piano album for 20 years, is a manifesto for life and a statement for this time when the world around him was quiet and silent.

With 12 beautiful and intimate piano tracks featuring his trademark melodies, the album was written while Ludovico was isolated at his home in Italy, working without any distractions or the usual commitments that come with his busy schedule:

""I felt a sense of freedom to abandon myself and to let the music flow in a different way. I didn't have a filter between me and what came out of the piano, it felt very pure."" – Ludovico Einaudi
