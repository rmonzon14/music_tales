LYRICS:
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin', 'cause I'm countin' no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare

Intangible (ah y'all), bet you didn't think
So I command you to, panoramic view (you)
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes?

Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional? Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy

Lifeless to those the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shift
Did you like it? Gut smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among knows possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics without did you make it?
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every sprouting tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes

I see destruction and demise
Corruption in the skies (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides

For me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind, that's the inner (fuck 'em)
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor

Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Cracker Island

On cracker Island it was born
To the collective of the dawn
They were planting seeds at night

To grow a made up paradise
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
But it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult) 
in end I had to pay (what world is this)
In the end I had to pay (I purged my soul)
In the end I had to pay (I drank to riot) 
Nothing more to say (I drank to riot)
 
They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x 2 
Fantasies 

What world is this? x2

On cracker island it was raised
By the collective from the grave
It only came out at night 
It ate up their paradise (paradise)
Where the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)
And it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (forever cult)
In the end I had to pay (what world is this)
Out there on my silverlake (I was not there)
In the end it will be great (beneath the hills)
I’m like a ship between the tides (I saw myself)
I held on I survived (there in the void)

They taught themselves to be occult
They didn’t know it’s many strategies x2
Fantasy

On cracker island It will die (forever cult)
Join the collective in the sky (forever cult)
And on a shining boat of light (forever cult)

Go up to paradise (what world is this) 
Where the truth is autotuned (I purged my soul)
And it’s sadness I consume (I drank to riot)
Into my formats everyday (I drank to riot)
In the end I had to pay (forever cult)

In the end I’ll have to pay (forever cult)
In the end I’ll be ok (forever cult)

Nothing more to say x3

Lyrics: 
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

Lyrics:
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to 
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers 
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do 
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through

Lyrics: 
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all
Over myself
To lick your heart
And taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we
Call it fall
I'll make it to the moon
If I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Lyrics: 
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Well separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up
And brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back

I gotta take it on the otherside

Well centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
The stranger things that never change my mind

I gotta take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long
Will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full
And I’m spillin' my guts
She want to know
Am I still a slut?

I gotta take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Mmm-push the trigger
And I pull the thread

I gotta to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Turn me on
Take me for a hard ride
Burn me out
Leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it’s born again

How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever had

(How long)
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s sad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Lyrics: 
Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on. 
When I sit alone, come get a little known 
But I need more than myself this time. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh 

When will I know that I really can't go 
To the well once more - time to decide on. 
Well it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside. 
Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride, 
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh 

The more I see the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go; 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow, 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

Ho! 
Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down. 
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do belive what we rely on, 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh 

The more I see, the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow. 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 
Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go. 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey oh yeah oh yeah... tell my love now 
Hey yeah yeah... oh yeah.

Lyrics: 
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you pick the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world? What does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Oh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty five
Just another way to survive

[Chorus:]
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

She's a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Chorus]

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say good bye to you
Too true to say say say...

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast...

Lyrics:
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black jack,dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it

And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow

Lyrics: 
Oh, oh

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, ""Hell, yes""
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiacbut I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go,blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut,well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah

Lyrics: 
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil, he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me, no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah

Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear cannon ball a roaring
Me? I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah
Whack for my daddy-o

Lyrics: 
New blood joins this Earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me

“‘Screaming Suicide’ addresses the taboo word of suicide. The intention is to communicate about the darkness we feel inside. It's ridiculous to think we should deny that we have these thoughts. At one point or another, I believe most people have thought about it. To face it is to speak the unspoken. If it's a human experience, we should be able to talk about it. You are not alone.”

LYRICS

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don’t recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide
 
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

And now you speak my name
You’ve given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don’t you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I’m exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I’m no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich & Robert Trujillo

↓ LYRICS ↓

It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway

I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life
